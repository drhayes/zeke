# zeke

A Zettelkasten-y note system for Sublime Text 3.

## Vision

Working in Sublime. Think of something. Hit a key to create a new note about it. Do a short search to see if it already exists through list of existing related notes. If found, great -- open that one. If not, create a new note with unique filename and basic starting template.

Notes are basically Markdown with YAML front-matter to define metadata.

While editing/after saving a note, pop up a panel that displays related notes -- similar tags, similar words, etc.

All notes are dumped into a single directory configurable by the user.

## Metadata

  * title
  * tags
  * dateCreated
  * dateUpdated
